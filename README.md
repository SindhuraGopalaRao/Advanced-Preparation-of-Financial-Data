#DATA 6545 Course Project 1: Advanced Preparation of Financial Data

Overview of the Project:
Understanding pricing strategies in the context of the Initial Public Offering (IPO) process has been receiving much attention. Most prior studies have however focused on information sources from post issuance periods, and understanding such strategies from the management’s perspective during the IPO process is still an open research issue. In this study, we analyze the inter-relationships between the management’s confidence (through the proxy of sentiments expressed in textual contents in the Management’s Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) sections in the prospectus) and the pre-/post-IPO valuations.

The client is seeking advanced and novel methods to prepare the collected data, for further predictive analysis of the “underpricing” phenomenon. We mainly focus on the data understanding and data preparation phases in the CRISP-DM model. 

Research Question:
The overarching research question is “ How to predict the IPO underpricing phenomena? ” In this competition, the main purpose is to prepare the data for predictive models answering the overarching research question.
